- Zettelkasten method comprises of three main types of notes. Literature, Reference, and Permanent Notes [[A Beginner’s Guide to the Zettelkasten Method#How does the Zettelkasten method work]]. Each note has a distinct objective and serves a specific function. (Other types of notes include fleeting notes and hub notes)
	- Literature notes: Notes you make on the side of the original text to add context, include your thoughts and key takeaways, or to summarize the point of the text. 
	- Reference notes: The technique of grouping information, organizing ideas into categories, and creating tags to help find grouped information at a later stage. There are different ways of referencing but hyperlink is the one I'll use. 
	- Permanent notes:  Stand-alone ideas that can be made without any direct context to other sourced information. Used as a recap or summary of the information just researched or learned, or just to jot down thoughts that came in while thinking about a topic. 
	- Fleeting notes: Random ideas, thoughs and information that untimely flow through your mind. Temporary reminders of ideas as unstructured and unorganized notes that may be used later. 


- Steps 
	- 1, Read and take smart notes. When working, write down your thoughts and the reasons why you are taking particular note of a piece of information. This way, you will better understand the focus and reasoning behind the information you jot down. Even better, summarize the information and write it in your own words as much as you can.
 
	- 2, Rewrite your notes for the Zettelkasten. Once you have collected and summarized the information, it's time to highlight some key elements. INclude index information like author's name, book location, or the link URL. For longet Zettels, **highlighting the learning objectives or key points ina  bullet list might be helpful**. The main point is to write your notes in such a way that you will easily be able to quickly get the gist of the material when you come across it again. 
	
	- 3, Adding structure to your Zettel. The objective of using the Zettelkasten method is to make knowledge relationships. Add a particular category or number-ID to the individual Zettels to help you link them to another in your system. Doing so will allow you to jump from a related idea or piece of information to the next without having to search through your archive for a particular keywords. You may come to a point where your database is filled with Zettels, expertly organized and linked to another, but you have lost the overview. In this case, you can create Hub notes to help you. **Hub notes** are Zettels about a certain topic with subtopics. They are similar to the index or the table of contents. Use hubnotes as a reference or index for your work. Write down the list of topics in your Zettelkasten with a description and reference number to help you find and access information easier and quicker.
	
	- 4, Ask questions and review as a habit. Note-taking or note collecting is great, but having access to a significant amount of information doesn’t make you smarter. Ask yourself questions when analyzing the information to help you develop your own ideas to the content or material. Make it a regular habit to review information in your Zettelkasten to jog your memory and encourage you to see patterns create connections between ideas and information.
