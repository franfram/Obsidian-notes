### Callback: 
In computer programming, a callback, also known as a "call-after" function, is **any reference to executable code that is passed as an argument to other code; that other code is expected to call back (execute) the code at a given time**.


### Expression
An expression is a syntactic entity in a programming language that *may be evaluated* to determine its value. It's a combination of one or more constants, variables, functions, and operators that the programming language interprets (according to its particular rules of precedence and of association) and computes to produce ("to return", in a stateful environment) another value. 
In simple settings, the resulting value is usually one of various primitive types, such as numerical, string, boolean, complex data type or other types. 


### Syntax
The syntax of a computer language is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements or expressions in that language. Applies to programming languages, source code and markup languages. 


### Primitive data types
Primitive data types are a set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed. Specifically it often refers to the limited set of data representations in use by a particular processor, which all compiled programs must use. 

### Infix operator
A function of two arguments, with the name of the function written between the arguments. e.g. `+` (yes, that's a function, an anonymous function??) 


### Scheduler
A program that arranges jobs or a computer's operations into an appropriate sequence. 
Schedulling is the action of assigning resources to perform tasks. The resources may be processors, or other things. The tasks may be threads, processes or data flows. The scheduler is the process that carries out the activity of scheduling.
