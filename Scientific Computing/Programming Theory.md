- Container (data structure):
	In CS, a container is a class, a data structure, or an abstract data type whose instances are collections of other objects. In other words, they are used for storing objects in an organized way following specific access rules. The size of the container depends on the number of the objects (elements) it contains. The underlying implementation of various types of containers may vary in space and time complexity allowing for flexibility in choosing the right implementation for a given scenario.
