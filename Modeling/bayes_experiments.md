### Why we need well-designed experiments

"In encapsulating the phenomenon of interest our probe intersects only part of the surrounding environment. Consequently the observational process will be sensitive to only those elements of the environment relevant to the probe. Well-designed experiments offer the promise of better isolating the target phenomenon, yielding a much cleaner observational process and more informative observations"

### Consequences of each experiment design
but there's no unique procedure for interrogating and environment and the phenomena within it, so theres never a singular experimental probe and instead each of the many possible procedures results in its own probe. So Each procedure in an experiment yields a different observational experiments
