In statistics, one often deals with data sets and prob distribs that are too large to effectively examine each possible combination of values. Instead, we use statistical measures to represent, with some loss of information, meaningful features of the distribution. 

#### Features of the distributions
##### Expected value (or Mean)
This measure can be uses when variables take on numerical values. 
The expected value of a varibale X, denoted E(X), is found by multiplying each possible value of the variable by the probability that the variable will take that value, and then summing the products.
