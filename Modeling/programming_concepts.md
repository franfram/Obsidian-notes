#### Escaping (\\)
m'When we say that we escape, using the \ operator, we mean that we avoid or escape the normal behaviour of the character that comes next'. E.g., If when writing math equations we use "\" to start a symbol, the normal behavour of \ in that context is not to write the character "\". So if we want to explicitly write that character, we have to avoid or escape the normal behaviour (in that context) by using the escape operator \. (WTF but yes). So if we want to write "\" in markdown math, we have to write "\\"

Not really working the \\ here, maybe look for another example.
