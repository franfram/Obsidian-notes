Our inferential target is the latent phenomenon we want to study, but no phenomenon exists in isolation. "Any phenomenon relevant to statistical inquiry instead manifests within some latent system that includes, at the very least, the mechanisms with which we can interact with it. In other word we can observe the phenomenon of interest only through its surrounding *environment*". m' dos that mean that the environment is the mechanisms with which we can interact with it????'

To make an inference we need an observational probe that explores the environment and hopefully the phenomenon of interest. 



 ### What is an observational process
 An observational process is defined by the interaction of the probe with the environment and the phenomenon. This observational process examines the latent system and induces (creates??) explicit observations that are sensitive to the phenomenon of interest.

 "It is any methodology that measures, collects, curates or manipulates observations sensitive to the latent phenomenom. (WHATS THE MEANING OF LATENT PHENOMENOM???). This includes, for exmaple, not only dedicated experiments explicitly deisgned to interrogate the phenomenon of interest but also retrospective analyses of incidental experiments or previously conducted experiments designed for other purposes."

"In encapsulating the phenomenon of interest our probe intersects only part of the surrounding environment. Consequently the observational process will be sensitive to only those elements of the environment relevant to the probe. Well-designed experiments offer the promise of better isolating the target phenomenon, yielding a much cleaner observational process and more informative observations"



### Why we need well-designed experiments

"In encapsulating the phenomenon of interest our probe intersects only part of the surrounding environment. Consequently the observational process will be sensitive to only those elements of the environment relevant to the probe. Well-designed experiments offer the promise of better isolating the target phenomenon, yielding a much cleaner observational process and more informative observations"

but there's no unique procedure for interrogating and environment and the phenomena within it, so theres never a singular experimental probe and instead each of the many possible procedures results in its own probe. So Each procedure in an experiment yields a different observational experiments

Distinct observational processes can become the basis of of independent analyses or even  components in a single joint analysis that aggregates data from multiple sources. 

In consequence, the observational process are bespoke to both the given phenomenon and the specific details of the probe used to investigate it, especially the environment with which the probe intersects. A critical aspect of statistical modeling is capturing enough of these details to isolate inferences about the latent phenomenon that can then be fairly compared across different experiments. **this is especially true when the specific behavior of the environment or the probe is transient or otherwise not exactly repeatable**. Without a rich understanding of the observational process, phenomenological inferences can poorly generalize outside the of the exact context of the given experiment, promoting more confusion than comprehension. 


Latent Phenomenon: 
Latent: 
(of a quality or state) existing but not yet developed or manifest; hidden or concealed. 

Phenomenon: 
a fast or situation that is observed to exist or happen, especially one whose cause or expl


Retrospective analysis:

Incidental experiments:
