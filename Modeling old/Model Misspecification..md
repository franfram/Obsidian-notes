Taken from: 

"A model, _f_, can be said to be misspecified if the distribution of data implied by the model (under best possible parameterization) differs in any way from the distribution of data under the true generating process. In the Kullback-Leibler divergence setting within which we are working, _f_ is misspecified if _K_(_g, f_) > 0. A model set can be said to be misspecified if all of its member models are misspecified. Misspecification can have a host of causes, including omission of real covariates, inclusion of spurious covariates, incorrect specification of functional form, incorrect specification of process error structure, and incorrect specification of measurement error structure."
